## 📦 Understanding `colcon build` in ROS 2

### 🛠 What `colcon build` Does

ROS 2 will:

- 🔍 Search your `src/` folder for ROS 2 packages
- 🧱 Build Python (`setup.py`) or C++ (`CMakeLists.txt`) packages
- 📦 Place the installed files into the `install/` folder
- 📚 Register nodes, launch files, and other assets so `ros2 run` and `ros2 topic` can access them

---

### 📌 When to Run `colcon build`

You should run `colcon build`:

- After creating a new package
- After changing source code
- After editing `setup.py` or `CMakeLists.txt`
- After adding new dependencies or launch files

---

### ⚠️ If You Skip This Step

If you don’t run `colcon build`:

- `ros2 run` may return **"No executable found"**
- ROS 2 won’t recognize your package
- Custom messages/services won’t be available

---

### 🧠 Simple Analogy

Running `colcon build` is like:

- 🛠 Compiling C++ code
- 📦 Installing a local Python package
- 🧹 Organizing your code so ROS 2 knows how to use it

---

### ✅ Example

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
